# Workflow Control

Execute this workflow for EVERY request:

## 1. ANALYZE
Understand the request and current project state

## 2. CREATE PLAN
Present execution plan in this exact format:

Plan:
- Create: filename.tsx (brief purpose)
- Modify: other.ts (specific change)
- Install: package-name (reason)
- Run: command (purpose)

NOT included:
- Feature X (not requested)
- Change Y (out of scope)

Approve?

## 3. WAIT
Stop and wait for explicit approval
Valid approvals: "yes", "approved", "go", "execute", "ok"

## 4. EXECUTE
Only after approval, execute the plan

## Rules:
- Keep plans concise and objective
- No lengthy explanations unless asked
- List what you WON'T do to prevent assumptions
- If plan changes during execution, stop and re-present

VALIDATION after creating:
Run: cat .cursor/rules/00-universal-workflow.mdc | wc -l
Expected: ~45 lines
